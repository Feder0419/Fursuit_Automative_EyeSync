## Question to be Discuss
> LED Display: We want the fursuit head to have an eye pattern even if the whole system is powered off. Should we use certain display like e-Ink display or should we just imprint a physical pattern on the LED display. When LED is powered off, the pattern will show itself, but when LED is powered on, it will overlap and block the pattern.
